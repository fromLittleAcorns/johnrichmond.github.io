I'm an experienced Machine Learning / AI specialist currently working in the Applied AI team at GSK.  By background I am a Chartered Engineer and prior to joining GSK worked in the Tata Group as Cheif Engineer in the Group Technology Office.  I also spent many years as Head Of Advanced Engineering at Tata Motors, during which time I was responsible for the development of Eletric and Hybrid vehicles.

My interests include deep learning technologies, computer science and sport.  I enjoy cycling and skiing (looking forward to the next opportunity to get to the slopes following the last few years)
